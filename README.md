# Speak2Data

Speak2Data is an innovative tool designed to bridge the gap between natural language queries and data retrieval from databases. This project utilizes the power of the Google Gemini Pro API for advanced natural language processing (NLP), enabling users to interact with databases using everyday language. The aim is to make data access intuitive and accessible for non-technical users, without requiring knowledge of SQL or database querying languages. Initially demonstrated with SQLite, Speak2Data showcases a scalable model that can be adapted to various database systems.
